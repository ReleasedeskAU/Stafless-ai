## Unreleased

### Fixed

- Jira assignee/reporter tags now use `displayName` from the issue payload, the
  same as the original connector-engine. Email is an optional extra field read
  only when already present; it is never required to capture the name. Syncs
  log source-to-tag and persisted-tag completeness, and reject partial
  bulk-fetch responses.
- Jira comments are fully paginated, ADF mentions/status/emoji/links become
  readable text, title/description/comments are read from the issue payload
  independently, and Jira 429s retry with Retry-After / backoff.
